Django To-Do List Project – Summary

I started this project as a training exercise to practice using different technologies. For this project, I used Django to create a simple To-Do List web application. Below are the main steps involved in its development.

git clone https://github.com/Fefavargas/todo-webpage-django.git
cd todo-app
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver

1. What is Django?

Django is a high-level web framework for Python that allows developers to build secure, scalable, and maintainable web applications quickly. It follows the Model–View–Template (MVT) architectural pattern and provides many built-in components, such as authentication, routing, an ORM, and an admin panel. This “batteries included” approach makes development faster, safer, and more organized.

To install Django, use the terminal:

    pip install django

2. Creating the Project Structure

After installing Django, the next step is to generate the base project and the application:
    django-admin startproject todo_project
    cd todo_project
    python manage.py startapp todo

startproject creates the main project folder and core configuration files. 
todo_project/
├── manage.py  — a command-line utility for interacting with this Django project (runs server, migrations)
└── todo_project/
    ├── __init__.py  — marks the inner folder as a Python package
    ├── settings.py  — project configuration (databases, installed apps, middleware, templates, static files)
    ├── urls.py — root URL router where you include app URLconfs
    └── wsgi.py — WSGI entrypoint for deploying the project to a web server

startapp generates a new application module—todo—where the to-do list functionality will be implemented.
todo/
├── __init__.py
├── admin.py  — register models with Django admin
├── apps.py  — app configuration (class Django uses to refer to the app)
├── models.py  — define database models (your data schema)
├── tests.py  — place to write automated tests
├── views.py — request handlers / business logic (where TODO app logic will live)
└── migrations/  — stores DB migration files (initially empty aside from __init__.py)
    └── __init__.py

3. Registering the App

Inside todo_project/settings.py, add the new app so Django knows it exists:
        INSTALLED_APPS = [
                          ...
                          'todo',
                      ]

4. Creating the Model (todo/models.py)

The model defines the structure of the data stored in the database:
    from django.db import models
    class Task(models.Model):
        title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        resolved = models.BooleanField(default=False)
        due_date = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
    
        def __str__(self):
            return self.title

5. Running Migrations

Migrations connect your models to the database.
makemigrations scans your models.py and generates a migration file explaining how the database should look.
migrate applies this file and creates the actual database tables.
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate

6. Creating the Views (todo/views.py)

views.py contains the logic that responds to user actions.
Every time a user visits a page, submits a form, or clicks a button, Django calls a specific view to decide what happens next.
    check my project to see an exemple of views.py

7. Configuring URLs

Django uses URLs to determine which view should handle a request.
There are two URL files:
Project-Level: todo_project/urls.py
This is the entry point for all URLs in the project.
It decides which app should handle a request.

App-Level: todo/urls.py
This file contains the routes specific to the To-Do application.
Each URL maps to a function inside views.py:

URL → view function → result shown to the user
        
8. Creating Templates (home.html and base.html)

Templates are HTML files that display information to the user.
Django’s template engine supports variables, loops, conditions, and template inheritance.

base.html
A master layout shared by all pages.
It contains the common structure (header, footer, layout, CSS links).
Other templates extend it to avoid repeating code.

home.html
The main page of the application.
It displays the list of tasks and the form to add new ones.
It extends base.html and fills in the content block.

9. Running the App

Start the development server:
            python manage.py runserver - terminal
            http://127.0.0.1:8000/ - browser
